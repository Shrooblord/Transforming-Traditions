Requirements for this mod TransTrads:
    - UI Overhaul 1080p & 1440p   -- new Traditions Screen is >= 1080p only!

### Overview: ###
1.  EITHER/OR:
        - Try a "Tech Tree", wherein you start at a root and work your way "down" different branches.
        - Try a "Tech Web", wherein you go down multiple paths from a "central spindle" and branch out into different areas that way.

2.  Instead of "Finisher Effects" unlocking an Ascension Perk, we unlock an Ascension Perk after "X number of Traditions" have been chosen;
    keep track of this using an additional progress bar underneath the "progress to next Tradition" bar: "progress to next Ascension Perk".

3.  Instead of the "number of Tradition categories" penalty to the Unity Cost of a next Tradition, base this penalty off of the number of
    total Traditions chosen alone. I.e. instead of 3 Cats = 3*5% extra cost, do 3 Trads = 3*0.5% extra cost, or similar.

4.  Alternatively, instead of 2. and 3., we could somehow define "categories" within this web / tree. Maybe call them Branches or something
    else that's cute. We need to clearly indicate in advance what the different Branches are though. Maybe we can do it all through spacing,
    i.e. distinctly group several Traditions (5? 5 is the norm...) together, and space the next Branch of 5 a ways away from the other, so
    that there's distinct grouping visually apparent from the start. Then we can keep the "Finisher Effect" *and* "Trad Cat cost penalty"
    systems in-place. Less work! more cool

### REFS: ###
1.  Extra Stellaris Traditions has some AMAZING new Traditions, but has some super-broken stupid ones like the Raiding and Malware ones.
2.  Plentiful Traditions has nice ideas, but goes way overboard in how brokenly overpowered they are.

3.  Idea: integrate EST to an extent, but just leave out certain Traditions.
4.  Idea: take PT as inspiration to craft new Traditions.
